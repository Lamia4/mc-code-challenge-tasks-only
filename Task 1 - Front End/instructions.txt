Instructions

Create a responsive web page according the following requirements:
1. Please, use the styling guidelines & mockup files that are inside the “Guidelines” folder:
	• Styling Guidelines -> 0-Style-Guidelines_1920X1080.jpg
	• PC Mockup -> 1-PC-Mockup_1920X1080.jpg
	• Tablet Mockup -> 2-Tablet-Mockup_768X1024.jpg
	• Mobile Mockup -> 3-Mobile-Mockup-Top_375X667.jpg
2. Use the images found in “Assets” folder.
3. Use the “text.docx” (in the main folder) for the page content.
4. Don't use any external CSS libraries (Ex.: Bootstrap).
5. Create a CSS “breakpoint” for mobile devices from a width of 600px down; (vertical layout).
6. The page should be fully responsive and should look as optimal as possible on any window size. Using a mobile first approach would be appreciated but is not mandatory.
7. Minimum screen size to consider is 320px.
8. In case a certain value of an element size/spacing is missing in the mockups, make it look as close as possible to the mockups.
9. The MobizCouture logo should not be possible to save with the command "right click – save as”.
10. Use proper images provided for each screen for improving the speed performance.
11. Create a zoom effect for each product image on mouse hover.
12. For mobile, a burger icon should appear instead of the existing menu. This icon will open the menu with transition from left to right when clicked and do the reverse animation when clicked again.
13. The first banner should have a close button and it should to be possible to hide the banner.
14. Change the text color of the top banner based on the current weather condition (use the following weather API for acquiring the needed data: https://fcc-weatherapi.glitch.me/ it can be any color of your choice).

For interactivity use only JavaScript code from scratch, without frameworks or libraries.
